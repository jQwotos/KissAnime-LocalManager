### Kissanime Download Manager
This is an adaptation of my original [KissAnime-Mass-Downloader](https://github.com/jQwotos/Kissanime-Mass-Downloader). The whole point of this version is to have a web interface that allows you to manage downloading anime and your already downloaded anime.

# Where is the program???
I will be using this repo to backup my files. Don't expect it to work until this message is removed.

# OS Support
Basically everything, this is supposed to run in a vagrant box for easy installation and just to make your life easier.

Features include:
* A webui (i'm going with a web interface because this is designed to be ran on a headless server)
* Ability to Download Anime (duh)
* Delete Downloaded anime
* Compress downloaded anime to save space
* Decompress compressed anime for viewing
